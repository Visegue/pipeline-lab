  # Used as a result of not being able to map environments directly as input:
  # https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/480#issuecomment-1021278915
  # Would rather use env variables without mapping outputs, it gets messy quick.
  # There are other alternatives that might be better, eg:
  # - Read environments directly in shared files
  # - Map env files to outputs
  # - Split one image to several inputs for deploy (registry, project, name, tag)
