# We currently run release on all branches, shouldn't be a problem as
# Semantic release is configured to have prerelease and release branches
# in itself.
# If it's not a prerelease/release branch, nothing should happen.
# To save up on action minutes and get a cleaner run history it
# would be possible to specify different files for different branches
# (build for dev branch, build+release for release branches).
# But then the action file branches need to be syncronized with the
# semantic-release configuration.
